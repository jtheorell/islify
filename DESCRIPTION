Description: This software is meant to be used for classification of images of
    cell-based assays for neuronal surface autoantibody detection or similar
    techniques. It takes imaging files as input and creates a composite score
    from these, that for example can be used to classify samples as negative or
    positive for a certain antibody-specificity. The reason for its name is
    that I during its creation have thought about the individual picture as an
    archielago where we with different filters control the water level as well
    as ground characteristica, thereby finding islands of interest.
